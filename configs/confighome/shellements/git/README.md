These are the defaults set when setting name and email. There also some signing stuff here to make sure it's me. The `credential` ones were auto generated and I don't really know why they are there. I can make a pretty good educated guess, but I like to know, and not guess. TODO: Look into `credential` later. The `pull` and `push` tags are simply what I think are sane defaults for my current workflow. Also, the `init` flag is what everybody should be using, we're not in the dinosaur age anymore.
